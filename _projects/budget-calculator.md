### The Problem

Keeping track of personal finances can be a challenge. Without a clear system, it's easy to lose sight of where your money is going. This project was born out of a personal need for a straightforward tool to monitor my own budget and make more informed financial decisions.

### Development Journey

This was a personal project that I built to practice my software development skills and create a useful tool for myself. The development process involved:

- **Designing a simple and intuitive user interface** with Tkinter.
- **Implementing the core logic** for tracking income and expenses using Python and Pandas.
- **Creating data visualizations** with Matplotlib to provide a clear overview of financial data.

    </div>

### Technologies Used

The Personal Budget Calculator was built using a combination of powerful Python libraries:

- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating charts and graphs to visualize financial data.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.



### Future Vision

While this was primarily a personal project, there are several ways it could be expanded in the future:

- **Adding more advanced features**, such as budget forecasting and goal setting.
- **Developing a web-based version** to make it accessible from any device.
- **Connecting to bank accounts** for automatic transaction importing.

This project was a great learning experience and has become an invaluable tool for managing my own finances.
