**Cal-Glass** is more than just a pair of glasses; it's a window into a healthier lifestyle. We've all been told to watch what we eat, but what if a device could do that for us? Born from the desire to make healthy living more accessible, Cal-Glass is a wearable device that uses computer vision to recognize the food you eat and provide real-time nutritional information.

### The Spark of an Idea

The journey began with a simple observation: managing your diet is hard. While we can easily track our calorie output with smartwatches, tracking calorie *input* is often a tedious manual process. This disconnect makes it difficult for people to build a truly scientific and effective diet plan. We envisioned a device that could bridge this gapâ€”a smart, wearable companion that would make food tracking seamless and automatic.

### From a Sketch to a Working Prototype

As the founder and team leader, I guided a team of seven to bring this vision to life. My role was multifaceted, spanning hardware design, software development, and project management. I designed and 3D-printed the glasses, assembled the hardware components, and developed the backend algorithms for food detection. It was a journey of collaboration and innovation.

The heart of Cal-Glass is a **Raspberry Pi** and a camera, powered by a **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** algorithm that recognizes different food items. This information is then sent to a companion website where users can track their dietary habits and receive personalized meal suggestions.

### Achievements and the Road Ahead

Our hard work paid off. We achieved **70% accuracy** in food detection and, more importantly, we helped one of our teachers lose half a kilo! The project was also awarded a **silver prize** in the CDB national competition, a testament to our innovative approach.

The vision for Cal-Glass doesn't stop here. We plan to integrate real-time body condition monitoring and exercise tracking to create a comprehensive health management tool.
