**Damaku-manager** is a passion project born from a love of a unique online video culture. In many parts of Asia, video platforms feature "Danmaku," a real-time commentary system where viewer comments fly across the screen. It creates a lively, shared experience that I felt was missing from YouTube. So, I decided to build it myself.

### Bridging Cultures with Code

The goal was to bring this fun and interactive feature to a global audience, promoting a bit of cultural exchange along the way. I dove into the world of Chrome extension development, learning how to build and publish an extension from the ground up.

### From Idea to a Published Extension

This was a solo journey of learning and building. I taught myself how to develop a Chrome extension, using **React** and **TypeScript** to create a clean and modern interface. The biggest challenge was figuring out how to overlay the comments on top of YouTube's video player, but after a lot of trial and error, I finally got it working. I open-sourced the project on GitHub and published it to the Chrome Web Store.

### Achievements

The response was amazing! Within a month of launching, the extension had:

- A user rating of **4 out of 5 stars**.
- Over **20 active users**.

It was incredibly rewarding to see that other people enjoyed the feature as much as I did.

### What's Next?

This project is just the beginning. I plan to expand the extension to other video platforms and add more customization options to give users more control over their Danmaku experience. It's a fun project that I'm excited to keep improving.
