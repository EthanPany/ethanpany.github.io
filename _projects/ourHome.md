**Our Home** is not just a game; it's a conversation. It's an exploration of what "home" truly means, especially for those of us who find ourselves far from the places and people we love. As an international student, I felt the pang of homesickness and the complexities of family relationships, and I wanted to create something that could help bridge that distance.

### A Virtual Space for Reflection

The game invites you into a 3D space that feels like a dorm room, filled with objects that hold special meaning. Each object is a metaphor, a trigger for a memory or a feeling. But the heart of the experience is the **AI philosopher**, a conversational agent designed to talk with you about your life, your family, and your relationships. It's a space to reflect, to understand, and to find a bit of home within yourself.

### A Journey of Learning and Creation

This project was a personal journey of discovery. I taught myself **3D game design** and **Unity** from scratch, learned **C#** to script the game's interactions, and integrated the **OpenAI API** to bring the AI philosopher to life. It was my first time working with these technologies, and the result was a working demo that I was proud to share.

### Achievements and Impact

**Our Home** was more than just a personal project. It was my final project for a writing class, and it earned a **full score**. I also showcased it at an on-campus exhibition, where over 20 people tried it and gave me their feedback. It was incredible to see how the game resonated with others and sparked meaningful conversations.

### Download and Play

The game is available for **free download**. I invite you to explore the space, interact with the objects, and have a conversation with the AI philosopher.

This project taught me that technology can be a powerful tool for exploring the human experience. It's not just about creating something functional, but about creating something that can connect with people on an emotional level.
