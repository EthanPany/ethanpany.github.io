We've all been there: a downloads folder overflowing with a chaotic mix of documents, images, and code. It's a digital mess that's a pain to clean up. That's why I started the **AI File Organizer** projectâ€”to create a smart assistant that can learn your organizational style and automatically tidy up your files for you.

### The Challenge: Beyond Simple Rules

Existing file organizers often rely on basic rules like file type or name, but that's not how we think. We organize based on content and context. The challenge was to build a tool that could understand the *semantic meaning* of a file and organize it in a way that makes sense to *you*.

### A Collaboration with OpenAI

This project is part of a special program at the **University of Wisconsin-Madison** in collaboration with **OpenAI**. As the leader of a team of three, I am driving the vision and development of this intelligent tool. My focus is on the core NLP pipeline: building a vector database to represent file content, extracting and summarizing information, and clustering files based on their meaning. We're not just building a file organizer; we're teaching a machine to understand and adapt to human behavior.

### The Technology Behind the Magic

We're using a cutting-edge stack to bring this project to life:

- **Python**: The backbone of our application.
- **LangChain & LiteLLM**: For orchestrating complex workflows with large language models.
- **OpenAI**: Leveraging their powerful models for content understanding.
- **PyTorch**: For machine learning tasks and building our vector database.
- **SQLite & Pydantic**: For robust data management.

### The Future is Organized

The AI File Organizer is an ongoing project with a bold vision: to make file management effortless. We're just getting started, but we're excited about the potential to create a tool that can learn, adapt, and bring a little more order to our digital lives.
