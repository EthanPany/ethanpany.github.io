If it’s a chaotic mix of documents, images, and random files, SolarFlow is here to solve that problem. We’re building an AI-powered file organizer that doesn’t just sort by file type—it understands content and context to create a personalized, intuitive file system.</p> <h3 id="the-problem-were-solving">The Problem We’re Solving</h3> <p>File management is tedious and time-consuming. Traditional systems rely on arbitrary rules that don’t match how we actually think about our files. File search isn’t as good as it could be, and maintaining organization requires constant manual effort.</p> <h3 id="our-solution-solarflow">Our Solution: SolarFlow</h3> <p>SolarFlow uses OpenAI’s tools to automate file management by creating a human-readable file system tailored to each user. We provide robust search functionality using file metadata and AI-generated summaries, making it easy to find any file—even when you can’t remember its name.</p> <h3 id="core-features">Core Features</h3> <p><strong>Moonsword</strong> - Our sorting agent that dives deep into every file, regardless of format, understanding content and generating intelligent summaries.</p> <p><strong>Neutron Store</strong> - A specialized database that stores all file information, including text embeddings and metadata for lightning-fast retrieval.</p> <p><strong>Supernova</strong> - The file organizing agent that uses database information to understand user preferences and sort files the way you would.</p> <p><strong>Lightspeed Search</strong> - Super-fast vector search that lets you find files based on content, not just filename.</p> <h3 id="technology-stack">Technology Stack</h3> <p><strong>Backend (Python)</strong></p> <ul> <li>FastAPI for core web framework</li> <li>Processing, database integration, and vectorization</li> <li>ChatGPT-4o Nano for text and image processing</li> <li>Whisper for audio/video transcription</li> <li>Text Embedding 3 for generating embeddings</li> </ul> <p><strong>Frontend (Swift/SwiftUI)</strong></p> <ul> <li>Native macOS interface with responsive design</li> <li>Direct Finder integration</li> <li>Real-time notifications for processing status</li> </ul> <h3 id="privacy--security-first">Privacy &amp; Security First</h3> <p>We prioritize user control and privacy:</p> <ul> <li>Only scan files from directories you choose</li> <li>Option to run models locally for privacy-conscious users</li> <li>System and hidden files are automatically ignored</li> <li>Full transparency in what files are processed</li> </ul> <h3 id="openai-collaboration">OpenAI Collaboration</h3> <p>This project is part of a special program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in collaboration with OpenAI. As team leader, I’m driving the vision while conducting research on benchmarking LLM file organization capabilities—work we plan to publish as an academic paper.</p> <p><strong>Interested in being an early user?</strong> We’re currently recruiting participants for our user study to help improve SolarFlow’s organization algorithms.</p> <h3 id="project-videos">Project Videos</h3> <p><strong>Team Presentation</strong></p> <iframe src="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/embed/secure/iframe/entryId/1_cdv8t09g/uiConfId/21415062" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p><strong>Live Demo</strong></p> <iframe src="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/embed/secure/iframe/entryId/1_pbky05lw/uiConfId/21415062" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p><strong>Folder Icon Demo</strong></p> <iframe src="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/embed/secure/iframe/entryId/1_cy7zim4n/uiConfId/21415062" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </body></html>
